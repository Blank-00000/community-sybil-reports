# Related Addresses

<!--
Provide a list of related addresses that are currently eligible for the Connext user airdrop.

The list must contain at least 10 eligible addresses at the time of review or it will not be considered. The eligible address list can be found here: [TODO]. Reports will be evaluated on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Example:
```
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000004
```
-->

# Reasoning

<!--
Describe how the addresses are related with as much detail as possible.

Example:

All addresses received funding from the same parent address `0x0..`. After funding, each transferred funds from Optimism to Arbitrum between 5:30pm UTC and 7:30pm UTC on September 23rd. On October 1st in the same window and sequence, the accounts sent funds from Arbitrum to Optimism. 
-->

# Methodology

<!--
Explain the method used to discover the addresses and provide proof that they are all related and likely operated by a single individual/entity with a high degree of probability. The methodology should be easy to verify or the report will not be considered. Please, also include links to any additional materials youâ€™d like to provide like a github repo containing the script used to uncover the reported addresses.

Example:

The reported addresses were discovered by checking irregularities in the number of bridge transactions made via Dune. The resulting addresses were analyzed to find repeating transfers at standard intervals and sequence.
