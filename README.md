# Community Sybil Filtering Program

As part of our efforts to create effective Sybil filtering for the airdrop, we’re inviting the Connext community to help spearhead some of these efforts. From August 24th, 2023 through September 1st, community members can help locate Sybil attackers and improve the airdrop allocations for real users.

Sybil hunters will receive 25% of the recovered NEXT if their report successfully uncovers Sybil attackers/addresses. 50% of the allocation earned will be available when claiming opens on September 05, 2023, with the remaining 50% unlocking in equal monthly portions over the subsequent 24 months.

It’s important to note that successful Sybil hunters will have to go through KYC in order to claim their reward. This program is not available for participants based in the US or from any US-sanctioned countries.

The reports will be collected within this repository.

## How to Participate

To report a group of addresses, [create an issue](https://github.com/connext/community-sybil-reports/issues/new/choose) on this repo and use the provided issue template.

Please see [here](./CONTRACTS.md) for more information regarding relevant contracts.

#### Rules:

- Reports will be reviewed on a first-come, first serve basis.
- Reports must contain at least 10 addresses still in `allocations.csv` at the time of review.
- The methodology and reasoning must be well explained and easy to understand.
- Methodology that has a non-negligible chance of eliminating legitimate users will not be considered.
- Successful submissions receive 25% of the recovered NEXT when providing a valid address (50% available at claim, 50% on 24 month unlock schedule).
- Reports have to be submitted to Github no later than September 01, 2023.
- Report acceptance / rejection is at the sole discretion of the Connext team.
