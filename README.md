# community-sybil-reports

This repository allows the community to help find sybil attackers and help determine the final user allocations.

The reports will be collected within this repository

## Reporting Rules

To report a group of addresses, [create an issue](https://github.com/connext/community-sybil-reports/issues/new/choose) on this repo and use the provided issue template.

#### Rules:

- Reports will be reviewed on a first-come, first serve basis.
- Reports must contain at least 10 addresses still in `allocations.csv` at the time of review.
- The methodology and reasoning must be well explained and easy to understand.
- Methodology that has a non-negligible chance of eliminating legitimate users will not be considered.
- _Successful submissions receive 25% of the “saved” NEXT when providing a valid address._ Remaining 75% is redistributed to the rest of the eligible users.
- Reports have to be submitted to Github before [TODO - date].
- Report acceptance / rejection is at the sole discretion of the Connext team.
